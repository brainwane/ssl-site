project metadata as frequently as every few minutes. This growing flow of updates
has created a large and potentially devastating new attack surface for malicious
actors, as malware submitted through this process offers the opportunity to
impact thousands of users at a time. The Update Framework (TUF) is a comprehensive,
flexible framework to secure software updates, even in situations where the repository
is compromised. Developers can integrate TUF into any software update system, or
native programming language due to its concise, self-contained architecture and
application. It’s adoption in 2017 by the <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io\">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>
of the <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/\">Linux Foundation</a> along
with Docker's popular implementation of the framework, now makes TUF the de facto

CacheCash provides a similar service in which interested users run caches, and are incentivized to participate by 
receiving a crypto-currency (Cachecoin) in exchange for serving content to other users. Both cryptographic and economic
techniques demonstrate that CacheCash users are either forced or economically incentivized to honestly serve content. 
Our analysis shows that CacheCash scales to meet the workload of even the most popular services used today. 
By building CacheCash, we intend to change CDNs by more readily and pervasively including end-user served content."

kernels contain flaws. Strategies to defend against triggering kernel bugs have fallen
short, and so have other metrics designed to tell designers how to avoid them. The Lind project has identified
a reliable metric for building securer designs. It posits that the popular code paths—ones used every day 
to access basic system requests—contain fewer bugs than less-frequently used paths. Operating on this principle,
our research group has built a virtual machine called Lind that locks onto the popular paths and, by doing so,
reduces the possibility of triggering flawed code. With the success of its initial application, the research

      so other applications can be tested against them. If any application fails to respond correctly, developers 
      know to anticipate and design for potential problems within that environment. Thus, the tool can save
      developers time and resource costs that would be incurred if tests were run in each individual 
      environment--or as maintenance tasks after deployment. And, because the tool can store these anomalies,

      description: "Virtual Secure Network (VSN) is a network service that provides remote users the security benefits of a managed (corporate/cloud) network, without sacrificing the faster Internet performance more typical of an insecure direct connection. A VSN is analogous to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in that it offers security protections, such as firewalls, multiple Antivirus scanners, IDSs, and IPSs. However, VSN can guarantee lower costs for management, and better performance for its end users."
